Leetcode #242
242. Valid Anagram
Easy

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false

 

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104
    s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        return sorted(s) == sorted(t)

567. Permutation in String
Medium

Given two strings s1 and s2, return true if s2 contains a permutation of s1, or false otherwise.

In other words, return true if one of s1's permutations is the substring of s2.

 

Example 1:

Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidbaooo"
Output: true
Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").

Example 2:

Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidboaoo"
Output: false

 

Constraints:

    1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 104
    s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.
